This website was coded by Xinyi Yao using RMarkdown to do all the hard work.

# Hi! I'm Xinyi Yao.

I’m a master’s student in Biostatistics at Columbia University, Public Health Data Science track. My interests sit at the intersection of statistical modeling, machine learning, and public health.
Right now, I’m focused on:

- Translating health questions into models and causal frameworks.
- Building end-to-end pipelines in R with R Markdown and git.
- Turning messy data into clear, decision-ready visuals and summaries.

On this site you’ll find my [resume](resume.html), [selected projects](repositories.html), and link to [professional profiles](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xinyi-yao105).
