# Interests and Hobbies
I love exploring new places—from quiet coastal towns to busy city markets—and I almost always come home with photos and a new snack obsession. I’m also a lifelong animal person and spend my off-hours caring for my pets and volunteering at local shelters when I can.

Here are pictures of my cats.
